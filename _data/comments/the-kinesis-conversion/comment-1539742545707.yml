  Thanks for this. I have a couple hundred Clear switches on the way and want to
  put some of them to good use on my Kinesis. The Kinesis people are great huh?
  By the way, on geekhack someone's got the 3D printer files for plates for the
  center clustersâ€”might just be a fun project, though I may just go with
  PCB-mount...
